# Exercise 3: Performance Optimization

## Overview
In this advanced exercise, you will use Cody to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in a Python program. Performance optimization is critical for applications that require efficiency and speed, especially in production environments.

## Objectives
- Use Cody to locate performance issues within a codebase.
- Learn techniques and strategies for optimizing Python code.
- Implement performance improvements while maintaining functionality.

## Instructions
1. Open the `optimize_me.py` file, which contains a computationally expensive Python script.
2. Use Cody to analyze the code for performance bottlenecks.
3. Refactor the code to optimize its performance based on Cody's suggestions.
4. Ensure that the optimized code maintains all original functionality and correctness.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully identify and refactor all performance bottlenecks in `optimise_me.py`.
- Demonstrate a clear understanding of performance optimization strategies in Python.
- Validate that the optimized code performs the same operations faster or more efficiently than the original.

### Task for Participants:
- Use Cody to identify the performance bottleneck in `find_duplicates`. The nested loop structure leads to excessive computational complexity.
- Refactor the function to use a more efficient algorithm. Consider using data structures like sets or dictionaries to reduce time complexity.
- Validate that your optimized code correctly identifies duplicates and performs better than the original.

This exercise will hone participants' skills in profiling and optimizing Python scripts, crucial for developing high-performance applications.
