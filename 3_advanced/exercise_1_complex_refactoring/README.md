# Exercise 1: Complex Refactoring

## Overview
In this advanced exercise, you will utilize Cody to significantly refactor a complex code base. The aim is to improve the code's architecture and performance. This task will give you insights into handling large-scale refactoring projects and understanding the importance of clean architecture.

## Objectives
- Use Cody to analyze and suggest improvements in a larger codebase.
- Apply refactoring techniques to enhance code structure, maintainability, and efficiency.
- Familiarize yourself with advanced refactoring patterns such as modularization and design pattern implementation.

## Instructions
1. Open the `complex_app.py` file, which contains a monolithic and inefficient application.
2. Use Cody to obtain suggestions for how to better organize and refactor the code.
3. Refactor the code to apply principles such as DRY, SOLID, and separation of concerns (SoC).
4. Ensure that the functionality of the refactored code remains consistent with the original.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully refactor `complex_app.py` into a well-organized, efficient, and modular codebase.
- Apply and discuss advanced refactoring techniques and design patterns effectively.
- Ensure that the refactored code performs all original functions correctly without introducing any bugs.

### Task for Participants:
- Use Cody to identify areas in `complex_app.py` where code could be refactored to improve maintainability. Consider creating helper functions, separating concerns, and implementing design patterns where appropriate.
- Modularize the `process_orders` and `generate_report` functionalities, possibly introducing classes to encapsulate related behaviors.
- Ensure the refactored code not only functions correctly but also adheres to best practices in object-oriented and clean coding.

By completing this exercise, participants will gain critical experience in handling complex code refactoring tasks, which are crucial for large-scale software development projects.
