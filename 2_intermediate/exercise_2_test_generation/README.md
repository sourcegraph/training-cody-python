# Exercise 2: Test Generation

## Overview
This exercise is designed to help you leverage Cody to generate tests for a given Python codebase. Writing tests is fundamental to ensuring your code works as expected and to prevent future changes from introducing bugs.

## Objectives
- Learn how to use Cody to suggest and generate unit tests.
- Understand the structure and components of effective unit tests.
- Implement tests that ensure code correctness and reliability.

## Instructions
1. Open the `code_to_test.py` file, which contains existing functions that require testing.
2. Use Cody to generate suggestions for unit tests.
3. Write at least three unit tests using a framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.
4. Run the tests to ensure that they pass and validate the functionality of the code.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully create and run at least three unit tests for `code_to_test.py`.
- Ensure all tests pass, confirming they correctly evaluate the intended functionality.
- Demonstrate an understanding of test-driven development principles and practices.

### Task for Participants:
- Use Cody to generate test case ideas for the functions in `code_to_test.py`, specifically focusing on edge cases and normal use cases.
- Develop unit tests for:
  - Basic functionality (e.g., `add(2, 3)` should return `5`).
  - Edge cases (e.g., what happens when input numbers are negative or zero).
- Implement the tests using Python's `unittest` framework and run them to ensure your functions are correct.

This exercise strengthens the participants' capabilities in using Cody for test generation, promoting best practices in software development and helping ensure the reliability of their code.
