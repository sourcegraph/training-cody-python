# Exercise 1: Debugging Workflows

## Overview
In this exercise, participants will learn how to utilize Cody to identify and fix bugs within a Python script. Debugging is a crucial skill for developers, and Cody can be an invaluable tool in swiftly diagnosing and resolving issues in code.

## Objective
- Practice using Cody to identify bugs in a script.
- Learn how to fix common coding errors with Cody's assistance.
- Enhance problem-solving skills by debugging a non-working Python script.

## Instructions
1. Open the `buggy_code.py` file, which contains a Python script with several intentional bugs.
2. Use Cody to help identify the issues in the code.
3. Correct all bugs and ensure that the script runs successfully.
4. Confirm that the output of the script is as expected.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully identify and fix all bugs within the `buggy_code.py` file.
- The script should execute without errors and produce the correct output.
- Participants should be able to explain the nature of each bug and how it was resolved.

### Task for Participants:
- Use Cody to identify the bugs in the script:
  - An issue with division by zero in the `divide_numbers` function.
  - Lack of error handling when attempting to divide by zero.

- Debug the script by:
  - Adding appropriate error handling to manage division by zero safely.
  - Ensuring that the script prints either the division result or a meaningful error message.
  
This exercise will enhance participants' debugging skills, while also demonstrating the power of using Cody to quickly find and fix issues within the code.
