# Exercise 3: Code Refactoring

## Overview
In this exercise, you will learn how to use Cody to identify areas for improvement in a given codebase and apply refactoring techniques. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, aimed at improving its structure and readability.

## Objectives
- Use Cody to pinpoint parts of the code that can be refactored.
- Practice refactoring code to improve clarity and efficiency.
- Understand common refactoring patterns and techniques.

## Instructions
1. Review the `refactor_me.py` file, which contains redundant and inefficient code.
2. Use Cody to suggest refactoring opportunities and strategies.
3. Apply refactoring techniques to improve the code structure and performance.
4. Ensure that the refactored code meets the original functionality.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully identify and refactor parts of `refactor_me.py` to enhance its quality.
- The refactored code should be cleaner, more efficient, and maintain the same functionality.
- Demonstrate the ability to recognize and implement common refactoring techniques, such as abstraction, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and simplification.

### Task for Participants:
- Use Cody to identify refactoring opportunities in the `process_data` function.
- Refactor the code to be more concise and efficient. Consider using list comprehensions, built-in functions, and other Pythonic approaches to reduce redundancy and improve clarity.
- Ensure your refactored code provides the same result as the original implementation.

This exercise will help participants enhance their ability to employ refactoring techniques, boosting code quality and development efficiency with the support of Cody's insights.
