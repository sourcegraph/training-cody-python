# Exercise 3: Simple Code Generation

## Overview
In this exercise, participants will use Cody to generate simple code functions. The task involves expanding the functionality of a basic Python script by writing additional functions based on Cody's suggestions. This will help participants learn how to use Cody to automate coding tasks and explore different coding possibilities.

## Objective
- Practice using Cody to generate new functions.
- Expand upon existing code with additional functionalities.
- Develop the ability to efficiently prompt Cody for useful code snippets.

## Instructions
1. Review the `generate_function.py` file, which contains a basic function. 
2. Use Cody to brainstorm and generate ideas for additional useful functions that can complement or enhance the existing code.
3. Implement at least two new functions in the script, using Cody's suggestions.
4. Ensure that the new functions are working correctly and integrate well with the existing code.

## Success Criteria
- Participants successfully add at least two new functions to the `generate_function.py` script.
- The new functions should perform meaningful tasks and extend the base functionality.
- The code should execute without errors, and the new functions should produce the expected results.
