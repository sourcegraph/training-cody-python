# Exercise 1: Code Explanation

## Objective
Practice using Cody to explain unfamiliar code.

## Instructions
1. Open `sample_code.py` in your editor
2. Use Cody to explain what the code does
3. Ask Cody specific questions about parts you find confusing
4. Try different prompts to get different types of explanations (high-level overview, detailed breakdown, etc.)

## Example Prompts
- "Explain what this code does"
- "What does the `defaultdict` do in this code?"
- "Explain this code step by step"
- "How would you summarize this algorithm in simple terms?"
