# Exercise 2: Documentation Assistance

## Overview
In this exercise, you will learn how to use Cody to assist with generating documentation for existing code. Documenting code is crucial for maintaining readability and understanding, especially when working in a team or on complex projects.

## Objective
- Use Cody to generate meaningful documentation for the provided Python code.
- Learn how to describe the purpose and functionality of code elements such as functions and classes.

## Instructions
1. Review the `undocumented_code.py` file, which contains a simple Python function with no documentation.
2. Use Cody to suggest documentation for the code.
3. Add docstrings and comments based on Cody's suggestions to enhance clarity.
4. Verify that the added documentation accurately reflects the code's functionality.

## Success Criteria
- The code should include clear and concise docstrings for all functions.
- Comments should be added where needed to explain complex logic.
- The documentation should be understandable to someone unfamiliar with the code.
